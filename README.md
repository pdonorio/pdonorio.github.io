Hi! I am `Paulie`.

### projects

I work as a software architecture, engineering the middleware layer.
My main goal is to let researchers in manipulating and organizing science datasets.

Some tools I've written to help:

- The [RAPyDo framework](https://github.com/rapydo)
- B2STAGE [HTTP API](https://eudat-b2stage.github.io/http-api) inside the [EUDAT Infrastructure](https://eudat.eu/)
- The [pipeliner](https://bioinformatics.cineca.it)


### blog

[self](chapters/self.md) & [half](chapters/half.md)

### teaching

I am a true *`Pythonista`* and predicate the Python language with the help of `jupyter notebooks`. For example:

- [some notebook slides](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/cineca-scai/lectures/blob/sns/material/2017/01_introduction.ipynb#/) (in read-only mode)
- [some more lectures](https://gitlab.hpc.cineca.it/training/data/tree/school-rome-2017) with instructions to reproduce the environment
- [main Python course](https://eventi.cineca.it/en/hpc/python-computational-science/roma-20170510) at @cineca
