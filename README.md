# Me

I work as a *software architecture* with complex engineering of the middleware layer in High-Performance Computing systems.

My main goal is to let researchers do easier jobs in manipulating and organizing science datasets.

Hello, my friend! I am **`Paulie`**. What's up?

Here you may find a few things about me.

## Projects

Some tools I've written to help:

- The [RAPyDo framework](https://github.com/rapydo)
- B2STAGE [HTTP API](https://eudat-b2stage.github.io/http-api) inside the [EUDAT Infrastructure](https://eudat.eu/)
- The [pipeliner](https://bioinformatics.cineca.it)


## Blog & thoughts

- `2017/09/19`: [a webinar]() about the EUDAT-B2STAGE HTTP-API
- `2017/08/01`: [self](chapters/self.md) (& [half](chapters/half.md))


## Teaching

I am a true *`Pythonista`* and predicate the Python language with the help of `jupyter notebooks`. For example:

- [some notebook slides](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/cineca-scai/lectures/blob/sns/material/2017/01_introduction.ipynb#/) (in read-only mode);
- [some more lectures](https://gitlab.hpc.cineca.it/training/data/tree/school-rome-2017) with instructions to reproduce the environment;
- [main Python course](https://eventi.cineca.it/en/hpc/python-computational-science/roma-20170510) at @cineca;
- An italian course to teach Python with Notebooks [for high-school students](http://j.mp/2hcG3Iw).
