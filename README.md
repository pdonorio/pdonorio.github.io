Hello, my friend! I am **`Paolo`**; my most-used-nickname is `paulie`. 

I love engineering *software architectures*, expecially middleware layers and help coordinate development upon those scalable systems. 

Make sure you get to follow my current journey at [Proof](https://proofmedia.io/), where we're trying hard to "bring trust back to the crowd", it's really something big :)

## Projects

Some tools I've written to help in the past:

- The [RAPyDo](https://github.com/rapydo) open-source framework;
- The [HTTP API](https://eudat-b2stage.github.io/http-api) application (based on *RAPyDo*) for the B2STAGE service, inside the [EUDAT Infrastructure](https://eudat.eu/);
- The [pipeliner](https://bioinformatics.cineca.it) tool for bioinformatics **NGS** datasets analysis;

I've also tried to list in the most minimal way [all the (IT) things I've spent my time so far](chapters/things.md). 


## Teaching

I am a true *`Pythonista`* and predicate the Python language with the help of `jupyter notebooks`. For example:

- [some notebook slides](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/cineca-scai/lectures/blob/sns/material/2017/01_introduction.ipynb#/) (in read-only mode);
- [some more lectures](https://gitlab.hpc.cineca.it/training/data/tree/school-rome-2017) with instructions to reproduce the environment;
- [main Python course](https://eventi.cineca.it/en/hpc/python-computational-science/roma-20170510) at @cineca;
- An italian course to teach Python with Notebooks [for high-school students](http://j.mp/2hcG3Iw).


## Blog & thoughts

- `2017/10/27`: EUDAT [developer meeting](chapters/helsinki17.md) and first stable release;
- `2017/09/19`: EUDAT-B2STAGE HTTP-API: [webinar](chapters/webinars/b2stage);
- `2017/08/01`: a NERD presentation about [myself](chapters/self.md);

I am also in the process of:

- converting [the previous blog](https://medium.com/@paolodonorio/latest) into markdown static pages;
- translating my [original italian pages](https://medium.com/@tempo_pause/latest) into english posts.
